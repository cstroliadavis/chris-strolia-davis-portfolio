      Chris has been developing high class, enterprise level, secure, efficient, scalable software for over two decades. In that time, he has had the opportunity to work with numerous different technologies in various large organizations. This has brought him a plethora of experience, not only with these tools and technologies, but also with various different types of people, environments and challenges associated with high quality, enterprise level development. As a result, he has learned to adapt quickly to changing environments, and more importantly, to work on elevating teamwork and team building within those areas as this has always had the most dramatic and long lasting positive effects in all circumstances. Chris regularly mentors other developers, helping them to more easily understand complex systems and processes, but also to understand why these systems and processes are in place and how they benefit the team and the organization. Chris is focused on continuous improvement, not only for himself, but for the teams and organizations in which he works. While Chris has learned that technologies come and go, and he can quickly adapt to them as they do, he has maintained a focus on Javascript and SQL based technologies for the bulk of his career and has a keen understanding of these technologies above all others.
