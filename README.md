> work ethic. That often leaves me with few mental resources or motivation to continue working on it outside of
> work (particularly on the massive scale projects I would want to create). I also love watching anime and doing
> woodwork. I love spending time "learning" about new things during my off time, so I'm frequently on sites like
> Medium looking at what people are talking about. I spend time on religious and volunteer service at times, and
> I have a certain level of, I'm not sure I would call it pride, per se, but perhaps dedication to keeping my home
> in order, including whatever my wife asks of me. I also have a dog to take care of. Point is, as much as I want
> to spend time building out my online portfolio, I've unfortunately had a difficult time prioritizing it.
>
> I've worked on quite a few technologies beyond React at this time and beyond, but this project should at least
> provide a glimpse of my skill. It might be good to have some context.
>
> While I had "some" React experience prior to this course, it was mainly fixing and improving existing React
> components and pages and rarely building any from scratch, nor applying any of my own patterns. This was the
> first opportunity I had to do so, but even this was constrained by the parameters of the course I was going to
> be teaching. I did my best to improve the code itself within the limitations I was provided and I probably
> could have done even more.
>
> Since then, I have done a lot more React work and I've built react applications from the ground up, applying
> numerous tools and concepts including Vite, Vitest, Storybook, RTKQuery, of course es/ts lint and more.


This is a basic project that highlights my skills and accomplishments. 

The project was written in React 17.
